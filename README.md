## Installing

1. Download the latest DuckDB ODBC driver from the [DuckDB Power Query Connector GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MotherDuck-Open-Source/duckdb-power-query-connector/releases) for Windows:
      - [duckdb_odbc-windows-amd64.zip](https://github.com/MotherDuck-Open-Source/duckdb-power-query-connector/releases/latest/download/duckdb_odbc-windows-amd64.zip)
1. Extract the `.zip` archive into a permanent location, such as `C:\Program Files\duckdb_odbc`, and install the latest DuckDB driver by running `odbc_install.exe`.
1. Check that the correct version was installed. To do this, open the Registry Editor by running `regedit` in the command prompt or `Run` dialog. Browse to the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBCINST.INI\DuckDB Driver` entry and check that the Driver field contains the version you installed. If not, delete the `DuckDB Driver` registry key and rerun the installer.

1. Open Power BI, go to File -> Options and settings -> Options -> Security -> Data Extensions. Enable "Allow any extensions to load without validation or warning".

      - [duckdb-power-query-connector.mez](https://github.com/MotherDuck-Open-Source/duckdb-power-query-connector/releases/latest/download/duckdb-power-query-connector.mez)

1. Create this folder if it does not yet exist: `[Documents]\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors`.

1. Move or copy the `duckdb-power-query-connector.mez` file into `[Documents]\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors`. Note that if this location does not work, you may need to place this in your OneDrive Documents folder.

## Turning on UTF-8 support in the Language & Region settings

UTF-8 is currently not supported in the DuckDB ODBC driver. As a workaround, you can turn on UTF-8 decoding in Windows. Note that this may change behavior for other applications, so please use with caution.

1. Open start menu and type "Language settings". Open the "Language & region" settings
2. Click on "Administrative language settings"
3. Click on "Change system locale"
4. Check the "Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support" and click OK

5. This prompts Windows to restart.
6. Next, open Power BI, click on "Options and settings" -> "Options" -> "Data Load" and click the "Clear cache" button.

Now, you should be able to load your UTF-8 encoded database with Power BI directly:
